•	1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?

>My first introduction into coding was an EDX course where I learned to make my very first game. It seemed to me as very logical, 
structured, and at the same time creative. 
>I enjoyed it a lot, but at that time I had a full time job that did not allow me to explore programming as much as I wanted. 
Later on I tried Codeacademy and Udemy studying HTML. That knowledge was incredibly useful when I was helping a friend of 
mine with her website. I noticed that although I was not an IT specialist I still needed minor knowledge of coding no matter 
what my profession would be in the future. For example, I was not able to set up Google Analytics just because I didn’t know Ruby. 
This was challenging and interesting. 
>I was born back that time, when there were no computers (am I that old?) and now I see modern kids having all kind 
of devices around them. 
It shows how high an impact of computers and the digital world make in our society.
I would like to become a professional in the IT field to make the future even more fascinating one.
